# Step 1: Use Maven to build the JAR
FROM maven:3.9.6-eclipse-temurin-21 AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy pom.xml and download dependencies first (for caching)
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

# Copy source code and build
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Use a lightweight JDK runtime to run the JAR
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the JAR from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the JAR
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
